# Numerical-simulation-of-a-CO2-absorption-Tower
The present repository contains the code developed in MATLAB to solve the numerical simulation generated to describe the CO2 behaviour inside an absorption tower. The code is linked to the dissertation project carried out at Durham University as part of the completion of the MSc in New and Renewable Energy in 2022.
